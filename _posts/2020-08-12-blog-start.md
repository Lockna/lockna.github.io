# Welcome to my first blog post

Hey! Here I will share important events and insights on my way to becoming a low-level software developer.

### About me
So, my name's Lockna (pseudonym) and I'm 16 years old. 
I'm currently living in Austria.
I'm a technology enthusiast and I'm very interested in Low-Level/Embedded programming
but I also find Hardware Hacking very interesting.

### How I got into programming
I was playing a lot of video games like Minecraft and also Farming Simulator.
After some time I became more and more interested in how it works behind the scenes.
Then I got a programming book for Christmas. It was about the programming language Java.
I also tried Minecraft Server Plugins but I didn't understand anything, so I let it go.
Some time later I discovered the school for software engineering.
I knew right away this was it. That's where I want to go.

### After the start of school
In the first class we didn't start programming immediately. We first went through the logic behind it on paper.
After this we started with C. Yes, C.
We started with C because it is a simple programming langauge in itself. 
Without class, interface and so on.
It was an imperative language, so we went through the basics. So control flow, loops and functions.
We also discussed pointers and worked with them. I found this topic very interesting.
After that the school year was already coming to an end and we discueed structs, but that was it.
In summer holidays I didn't do much of programming.
In second grade, our langauge was C#. 
We learned a lot this year.
Data structures, Binary Search Tree's and and most importantly OOP in C#.

### How I got to C
It was quite interesting, but somehow not what really interested me.
I bounced back and forth between several languages.
Scala, Go, Java, Rust.
I took a lot form them, but I never really learned any of them.
I thought that I would not find a langauge that would meet my requirements.
But I was wrong.
My attention was drawn to C again.

So I decided to go back to C and learn this language properly.
I learned it for about 1.5 years now and I can say, I'm not so bad at programming in C :)
But then I learned less and less new things, because I simply did not try anything new.
One day I was contacted by a well-known guy on Discord and he asked me if I would like to develop a small kernel with him and some people.
I did ths project with them and learned a lot. After some time we all had less time, so we stopped. 
What I find a pity until today.

I then teamed up with someone from my class and we started to develop a programming language together.
The GitHub repository is public, you are welcome to drop by [https://github.com/hawk-language/hawk](https://github.com/hawk-language/hawk)
As you can see, we've only completed the Lexer so far.
But we will continue it one day. (At least I hope so)

### How I got into low-level
As I mentioned before, I was working on a kernel, so this was on of my first steps in low-level programming.
We also did some Arduino programming in school.
It was one of my favorite subjects.
But, not so long ago I got onto a Discord server and I was talking to the people.

They reawakened my interest because I did nothing at all during the coronalockdown in Austria.
So I started to program a 6502 Emulator and since I'm not so bad at C anymore I tried something new.
I started learning Rust. It's really a great langauge. I love it!

So, now and then I develop at Volve (the name of my Emulator, Assembler and Disassembler toolchain),
but I wanted to go deeper into these things.
They recommended me to buy a ARM Development board and develop some Bare-Metal Drivers.
I got told the 1-Bitsy would be the perfect match for me, but unfortunately it was sold out.
I didn't find it anywhere on the internet. Well one shop had it, but I would have had to pay 25$ for shipping.
So I asked for another development board. Then I bought the Teensy 4.0. It has an ARM Cortex-M7. 
That's a pretty neat thing.

But I would recommend a STM32 board. Like a Nucleo board or something. Since, the Teensy has a proprietary bootloader and such things. 
But I have the Teensy and I'll stick with it.

That's my story so far and I'll keep you posted.

See you around,
Lockna
